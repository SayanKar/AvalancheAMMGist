The purpose of this tutorial is to teach the concept of AMM (Automated market maker) and to build a simple AMM. It will help the commumnity to understand about the internal working of the AMM and will give them the ability to build more complex AMMs. The learners will get to know how to integrate the frontend with avalanche using Ethers.js.
